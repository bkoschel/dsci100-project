## Title: Heart Disease and Age, Sex, and Cholesterol Levels.

## Introduction:

**Background:** Heart disease is a term that encompasses several different types of heart conditions(1). The most common condition is know as coronary artery disease (CAD) which can lead to decreased blood flow to the heart resulting in a heart attack (1). As a prominent cause of mortality in Canada, heart disease underscores the significance of investigating factors that may contribute to its development (2).

**Question:** We want to know if age, sex, and cholesterol levels might play a role in the presence or absence of heart disease. 

**ID and Describe the dataset used:** The dataset we are using to answer this question is heart disease dataset from the Cleveland provided to us through the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (3). It contains 14 attributes including age, sex, a chest pain scale, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar levels, resting electrocardiograph results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy, and diagnosis of heart disease.



## Preliminary exploratory data analysis:


## Methods

**age:** age in years

**sex:** male ("M") or female ("F")

**cp:** chest pain type (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)

**trestbps:** resting blood pressure (on admission to the hospital)

**chol:** serum cholesterol in mg/dl

**fbs:** fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

**restecg:** resting electrocardiographic results (Value 0: normal, Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)

**thalach:** maximum heart rate achieved

**exang:** exercise induced angina

**oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

**slope:** the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)

**ca:** number of major vessels (0-3) coloured by fluoroscopy

**thal:** 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

**num:** diagnosis of heart disease


## Expected Outcomes

What do you expect to find?

We anticipate uncovering insights into the relationship between age, sex, cholesterol levels and the presence or absence of heart disease. These findings could shed light on potential risk factors and help develop targeted interventions for at-risk populations.

What impact could such findings have?

The impact of these findings could be significant in terms of public health. Understanding how age, sex, and cholesterol levels influence heart disease can inform preventive strategies and healthcare policies, ultimately reducing the burden of heart disease in Canada.

What future questions could this lead to?

These findings may lead to several follow-up questions and research directions, such as:

1. Are there other demographic or lifestyle factors that interact with age, sex, and cholesterol levels to influence heart disease risk?

2. How can the knowledge gained be translated into personalized healthcare interventions?

3. Can the dataset be expanded or combined with other sources to provide a more comprehensive understanding of heart disease risk factors?

4. What are the long-term health implications for individuals who are at higher risk due to age, sex, and cholesterol levels and how can these be mitigated?

Answering these questions could further advance our understanding of heart disease and guide efforts to prevent and manage it effectively.
